# Introduction

This program calculates Pareto–Lorenz (PL) curves for calculating the relative abundance of different bacteria in a community. It also calculates a Gini coefficient to show how evenly distributed the different bacteria are. There are tests written for most functions. Your task is to:

1. Fork this repository
2. Setup Travis-ci:
   If you don't already have one, create a travis-ci (https://travis-ci.org/) account. Sign in with your github to this.
    * Add a new repository in Travis by clicking on the + button 
    * You should now be able to view the state of each build on the Travis webpage. Every push to the repository will trigger Travis to rebuild.
    * There is a link to a badge automatically produced by Travis at the top of this readme file, you will need to update this to the address of your own repository.

3. Setup codecov.io
   Codecov.io reports the test coverage percentage. Travis can produce and pushes reports to codecov. As with travis you need to create an account linked to your github page at https://codecov.io/login/gh.
   * Click on your user name and choose "add repository"
   * Find the pl_curves repository and go to Settings->Badge, copy the markdown and replace the codecov badge link on line 4 of this file.

4. Fix the broken tests.
5. Add python 3.8 as a target language in the .travis.yml file, fix any errors which result from this.
6. Upgrade to Pandas version 1.03 and see what breaks.
7. (optional) send a pull request to the original repository (https://github.com/colinsauze/pl_curves)
